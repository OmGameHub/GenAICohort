## Example output
> 13 + 2 * 7
ðŸ¤”: The user has presented a mathematical expression involving both addition and multiplication.
ðŸ¤”: According to the order of operations, multiplication takes precedence over addition. Therefore, I should first evaluate 2 * 7 before proceeding to addition.
ðŸ¤”: Start by calculating the multiplication: 2 * 7 = 14.
ðŸ¤–: Now, I need to add 13 to the result of the multiplication: 13 + 14.
